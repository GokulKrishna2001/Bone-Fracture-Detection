# Bone Fracture Detection
A basic implementation of detecting X-Ray images with bone fractures.

Done with the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vuppalaadithyasairam/bone-fracture-detection-using-xrays

The reference paper: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2665917423000594?ref=pdf_download&fr=RR-2&rr=89aeb821fc6c17b3

The basic architecture:

The accuracy given in the paper and the accuracy obtained is entirely different as different datasets were used for this. For different datasets, this technique will work, provided the file reading code block is edited accordingly.
